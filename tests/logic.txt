INPUT
dt = time step; default = 2.5e-5
dt_out = spacing of timesteps the user wants output to phi_t; default = NaN <-- default should be changed to 1
pathname: name of path to which phi is printed; default = "cd"

OUTPUT
t_out: time array corresponding to dt time step outputs
phi_t: phi over t_out time steps

downsampled = nx*ny*t_iter > 1e9: if True, force downsampling because phi_t will be too large to keep as variable
optdownsampled = dt_out > 1: if True, user requested downsampling by setting a dt_out larger than 1

if no downsampling is necessary or requested:
    #initialize variables
    t_out = 0:dt:(t_iter-1)*dt <-- should go from 0 to t_iter*dt
    t_spacing = 1 <-- replace t_spacing with dt_out variable
else: must downsample
    if the user did not opt to downsample:
        t_iter_ds = 1e9/nx/ny (max possible number of iterations)
        t_spacing = t_iter/t_iter_ds (set to dt_out when automatic downsampling is applied)
    else if the user does specify downsampling:
        t_spacing = dt_out
        t_iter_ds = t_iter/dt_out
    if dt_out is NaN or the user opted to downsample 
        #initialize variable phi_t; otherwise it will be printed to file
    t_out = 0:t_spacing*dt:(t_iter-t_spacing)*dt; <-- replace with 0:dt_out*dt:(t_iter)*dt_out*dt
